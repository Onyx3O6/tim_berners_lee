            <h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
            <h4>British scientist</h4>

            Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955,
            London, England), British computer scientist, generally credited as
            the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was awarded a
            knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the
            inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish
            Technology Award Foundation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents
            worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer. (See
            computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in
            1976 from the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer
            software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located
            in Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions
            in the computer industry, including a stint from June to December
            1980 as a software engineering consultant at CERN, the European
            particle physics laboratory in Geneva.
          </p>

            While at CERN, Berners-Lee developed a program for himself, called
            Enquire, that could store information in files that contained
            connections (“links”) both within and among separate files—a
            technique that became known as hypertext. After leaving CERN,
            Berners-Lee worked for Image Computer Systems Ltd., located in
            Ferndown, Dorset, where he designed a variety of computer systems.
            In 1984 he returned to CERN to work on the design of the
            laboratory’s computer network, developing procedures that allowed
            diverse computers to communicate with one another and researchers to
            control remote machines. In 1989 Berners-Lee drew up a proposal for
            creating a global hypertext document system that would make use of
            the Internet. His goal was to provide researchers with the ability
            to share their results, techniques, and practices without having to
            exchange e-mail constantly. Instead, researchers would place such
            information “online,” where their peers could immediately retrieve
            it anytime, day or night. Berners-Lee wrote the software for the
            first Web server (the central repository for the files to be shared)
            and the first Web client, or “browser” (the program to access and
            display files retrieved from the server), between October 1990 and
            the summer of 1991. The first “killer application” of the Web at
            CERN was the laboratory’s telephone directory—a mundane beginning
            for one of the technological wonders of the computer age.
