          Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955,
          London, England), British computer scientist, generally credited as
          the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was awarded a
          knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the
          inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (â‚¬1 million) by the Finnish
          Technology Award Foundation.

          Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked
          on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer. (See computer:
          The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in 1976 from the
          University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer software for two
          years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., located in Poole, Dorset,
          England. Following this, he had several positions in the computer
          industry, including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software
          engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics
          laboratory in Geneva.
